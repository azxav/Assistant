# Project Title

A brief description of your project.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using:

- Next.js (React framework)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- (Potentially Firebase Studio, based on initial README)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_folder_name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

    The application will hot-reload as you edit the files.

## Building the project

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `.next` folder with the production build.

## Running the production build

To run the built application:

```bash
npm start
```

## Project Structure

A brief overview of key directories:

- `src/app/`: Contains your Next.js application pages and routing.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
  - `common/`: Common components.
  - `icons/`: Icon components.
  - `ui/`: UI components (likely from a component library like shadcn/ui based on file names).
- `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
- `src/lib/`: Utility functions and libraries.
- `src/ai/`: Potentially related to AI or backend functionality (e.g., Genkit).
- `public/`: Static assets.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm start`: Runs the production build.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the project.

(Add any other scripts from your `package.json` here)

Replace `<repository_url>` and `<repository_folder_name>` with your actual repository details. You should also fill in the `Project Title` and `A brief description of your project` sections with relevant information about your specific project.

## Knowledge Base Backend

This project includes a knowledge base backend powered by Python, FastAPI, Google's Gemini, and Supabase.

### Setting up Supabase

1. **Create a Supabase Project**
   - Go to [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/) and sign up/login
   - Create a new project with a name like "kb-project"
   - Choose a strong database password and save it securely
   - Select a region closest to your users

2. **Get API Credentials**
   - After project creation, go to Project Settings â†’ API
   - Copy your `URL` and `anon public` key
   - These will be used as `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables

3. **Create Required Tables**
   - Go to Table Editor in your Supabase dashboard
   - Create two tables:

   **Table 1: embeddings**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE embeddings (
     id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
     content TEXT NOT NULL,
     embedding VECTOR(768),
     metadata JSONB,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

   **Table 2: hnsw_indices**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE hnsw_indices (
     id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
     index_name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
     index_data TEXT NOT NULL,
     mapping_data JSONB NOT NULL,
     max_elements INTEGER,
     ef_construction INTEGER,
     m_parameter INTEGER,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

4. **Create a .env file** in your project root:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
   ```

5. **Get Gemini API Key**:
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create an API key and add it to your .env file as `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

### Running the Knowledge Base Service

1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r python_kb/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start the service**:
   ```bash
   npm run kb:dev
   ```

3. **Access the API documentation**:
   Open your browser to http://localhost:8000 to see the Swagger UI.

4. **Index a sample document**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/index-file \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"path":"./docs/sample.txt"}'
   ```

5. **Ask a question**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"question":"What is our refund policy?"}'
   ```

### Integration with Next.js

You can integrate the knowledge base with your Next.js frontend by creating API routes that communicate with the knowledge base service.
