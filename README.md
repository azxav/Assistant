# Project Title

A brief description of your project.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using:

- (Potentially Firebase Studio, based on initial README)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_folder_name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

    The application will hot-reload as you edit the files.

## Building the project

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `.next` folder with the production build.

## Running the production build

To run the built application:

```bash
npm start
```
